                                                URL Dispatcher

To design URLS for app, you create a python module informally named urls.py. This module is pure python code and is a mapping between URL path expressions to view functions

urls.py

urlpatterns = [
    path(route, view, kwarges= None, name=None),
]



urls.py

urlpatterns = [
    path('learn/', views.django_learn),
]











                                                URL Patter inside Project

urls.py is used tto defie url pattern attached with the application or view of application or view function of application

urls.py is located inside inner project folder not inside application folder . Defined url name will be used by application user to get response from the application or view function of the application

steps:
1. open urls.py
2. import module ( python file ) of the application
3. write url name and map it with function

ex:
from course import views
urlpatterns = [
    path('learn/', views.django_learn),
]


* django_learn function is written in the applications views.py file



# Single application with single function

views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse
def learn_django(request):
    return HttpResponse('HELLO DJANGO')


urls.py
from course import views
urlpatterns = [
    path('learn/', views.django_learn),
]





we can define multiple url for one view function . means we can access same view function with multiple urls
example:

urls.py
from course import views
urlpatterns = [
    path('learn/', views.django_learn),
    path('course/', views.django_learn),
]

output:
http://localhost:5000/learn/
http://localhost:5000/course/ 
shows the same result ( same page )
